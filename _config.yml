            During my study I was working on theoretical questions in the field of dynamical systems with professor S.Yu. Pilyugin.
            I have obtained a new result for dynamical systems generated by special group actions.
            This result was [published](http://vestnik.spbu.ru/html18/s01/s01v4/10.pdf). Also I gave a talk on my results at Freie Universit√§t Berlin at November 2016.

            I lead a work of ML team of 5 researchers / engineers. My key tasks include curating all the team members by suggesting new solutions and code reviewing.
            I develop our main code repository and solve the most difficult parts of our problems.
            From business point of view I play the role of translator from business language into mathematicaly correct tasks.  \
            We develop algorithms for remote sensing data segmentation combining domain research and modern deep learning techniques.

            Created mathematical models for prediction of passenger traffic and airport capacity based on self-developed queue simulation tool.
            Also I integrated into airport data system my algorithm which automatically allocates parking stands for aircrafts on daily basis. This algorithm is still in use at Saint Petersburg airport.

          This project started as the research how much useful data we can extract from open source remote sensing data (Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, ALOS & Arctic DEM).
          The main challenge was the relative small resolution of the available data (10 - 100 m/px), so some problems like connected road graph detection required developing algorithms different from traditional CNNs.
          At the moment we successfully detect roads, buildings, water objects, wetlands, forests (and their types), estimate biomass volumes and CO2 consumption, detect clouds,  sand spots, and upscale data resolution.
          Solutions for some of the listed problems (on the similar data resolution) are not published in the scientific papers, but where such comparison can be correctly performed - our results are close and sometimes (depending on the region) even higher than the SOTA.  \
          **Algorithms stack:** modern architectures for semantic segmentation (U-net and its variants, FarSeg, Swin transformer U-net) and some self-made architectures. We use ESRGAN, SwinIR and custom architectures for image super-resolution. Also we use CRFs for postprocessing.  \
          **Technology stack:** PyTorch, Shapely, GDAL, PostgreSQL, GeoAlchemy, FastAPI, Docker  \
          Currently we are packing our solutions into QGIS software plugin for our customer.

          At this project I was developing algorithms for multi-factor optimization of general topology, network of roads and pipes to minimize total construction cost.
          As the result we have provided solution that is more cost and space utilization efficient than the one, which was manualy developed by the expert.  \
          **Algorithms stack:** Bayessian optimization, Dijkstra, SGD  \
          **Technology stack:** PyTorch, Shapely, GDAL, Optuna, PostgreSQL, GeoAlchemy, Graphene, Docker
